<h2>Bankers-Algorithm</h2> 

<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>
The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems. It ensures that processes in a system won't end up in a deadlock state by checking whether granting a resource request will leave the system in a safe state or not. In this project, we'll create a simulation of the Banker's Algorithm where users can interactively allocate and release resources to processes and see how the algorithm determines whether the system is in a safe state or not.

<h3>Features:</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Interactive UI: Users can interact with the simulation by allocating and releasing resources to processes.</li>
     <li>Resource Allocation: Users can allocate resources to processes, and the system will check if the allocation is safe or not.</li>
     <li>Resource Release: Users can release resources from processes, and the system will reevaluate the state to see if it's still safe.</li>
     <li>Safe State Indicator: The system will indicate whether the current state is safe or not after each allocation or release action.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

    <li>HTML: For structuring the web page.</li>
    <li>CSS: For styling the UI elements and making the simulation visually appealing.</li>
    <li>JavaScript: For implementing the logic of the Banker's Algorithm, handling user interactions, and updating the UI dynamically.</li>
  </ul>
